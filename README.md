A simple web application, build maily with Symfony, for a full-stack job application to FoodPanda.

>
> A weather API should check the local temperatures each hour and send an email to the Alert's email address.

### Requirements:
- Composer
- Symfony-CLI
- PHP ^7.2

### Steps to set up the project locally:

- set the default enviromental parameters, database connection, mailing service credidentials, etc.

Create a local .env file from the exemplary .env.dist in app root.

- Install the php components
`composer install`

- Create the SQLite database file
`php bin/console doctrine:database:create`

- Run the default migrations
`php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`

- Install the neccessary JS packages in /public
```
cd public
npm install
```

- Serve the application to a port
`symfony serve`

- Open in the browser
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

- Alternatively, to bypass the hourly cron and run the email service right away, access: 
`/api/cron`

### Things that needs more work, or I didn't have time for
- [ ] Modal interface for user friendliness, instead of the current button clicking twice for data overwriting.
- [ ] A real caching system (exp: PHP FileCache) for the API calls, to reduce traffic.
- [ ] The 1 mail / 24h limit. Currently every Alert stored lives individually, and the 24h limit applies onto to themselves, not across linked email addresses.
- [ ] Proper CRUD functionality of the Alerts.
- [ ] Unit and other tests.
